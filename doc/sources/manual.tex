{\bf \large Abstract}
\end{center}

In this document we present the user manual for the {\tt APFEL}
library. Written in {\scshape Fortran 77}, all the functionalities can
also be accessed via the {\tt C/C++} and {\tt Python} interfaces.  For
simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the description of the {\tt
  C/C++} interface, but the usage of the {\scshape Fortran 77} and
{\tt Python} interfaces is very similar and examples of their use are
provided in the {\tt examples} folder of the {\tt APFEL} source code.
First of all, we will discuss how to install {\tt APFEL} and how to
execute the basic example programs. After that, we will list the
various customization options that can be accessed by the user for
both the PDF evolution and the DIS structure functions modules.

\section{Installation}

The  {\tt APFEL} library is available from its {\tt HepForge} website:
\begin{center}
{\bf \url{http://apfel.hepforge.org/}~}
\end{center}
and from the {\tt GitHub} webpage:
\begin{center}
{\bf \url{https://github.com/scarrazza/apfel}~}
\end{center}
It can also be accessed directly from the {\tt git} repository.
The last development version can be downloaded by giving:
\begin{lstlisting}
  git clone https://github.com/scarrazza/apfel.git
\end{lstlisting}
For the tagged versions one can use the {\tt git} tag commands:
\begin{lstlisting}
  git tag -l
  git checkout tags/tag_name
\end{lstlisting}
to switch to any of the past releases. We strongly recommend to use
the latest stables release.

The installation of the {\tt APFEL} library can be easily done
following the standard {\tt autotools} sequence:
\begin{lstlisting}
  ./configure
  make
  make install
\end{lstlisting}
which automatically installs {\tt APFEL} in {\tt /usr/local/}. Note
that by default the {\tt APFEL} library requires an installation of
the {\tt LHAPDF} PDF library\footnote{The current release of {\tt
    APFEL} assumes that {\tt LHAPDF} version 6 has been previously
  installed as version 5 is no longer supported.}. However, an
LHAPDF-less installation is also supported by giving:
\begin{lstlisting}
  ./configure --disable-lhapdf
\end{lstlisting}
To use a different installation path, one simply needs to
use the option:
\begin{lstlisting}
  ./configure --prefix=/path/to/the/installation/folder
\end{lstlisting}
In this case, the {\tt APFEL} installation path should be included to
the environmental variable {\tt LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}. This can be done
adding to the local {\tt .bashrc} file (or {\tt .profile} file on Mac)
the string:
\begin{lstlisting}
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/the/installation/folder/lib
\end{lstlisting}

Once {\tt APFEL} has been properly compiled and installed, the
configuration script {\tt apfel-config} should automatically be
present. Such script is useful to determine the compiler flags. Type:
\begin{lstlisting}
  apfel-config --help
\end{lstlisting}
in a shell to see all the possible options. Particularly useful is the
{\tt --list-funcs} flag that lists all the functions available in {\tt
  APFEL} along with a short explanation. In addition, also the shell
script {\tt apfel} is provided which starts an interactive console
session of {\tt APFEL} providing a prompt tool to use the library
without coding.

In the following we will list and illustrate all the functionalities
of {\tt APFEL} and explaining how they can be accessed by the
user. The most recent version of {\tt APFEL} provide also an
additional module to compute DIS (and SIA) structure functions in
different mass scheme. Such module is dependent of the original PDF
evolution module as it inherits from it many of the setting functions
that we will describe in the next section. We will start describing
the functions of the PDF evolution module and we will devote the
following section to a thourough description of the DIS module.

\section{The PDF evolution module}

The basic usage of the PDF evolution module of {\tt APFEL} requires
only two steps to have the complete set of evolved PDFs. The first
step is the initialization of {\tt APFEL} through the call of the
following function:
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::InitializeAPFEL();
\end{lstlisting}
This will precompute all the needed evolution operators that enter the
discretized DGLAP equation. Let us recall that once the general
settings of the evolution have been defined (perturbative order, heavy
quark masses, reference value of $\alpha_s$, and so on), the
initialization needs to be performed only once, irrespective of the
scales that are used in the PDF evolution. The second step consists in
performing the actual PDF evolution between the initial scale {\tt Q0}
and the final scale {\tt Q} (in GeV). This can be achieved using the
function:
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::EvolveAPFEL(Q0,Q);
\end{lstlisting}
Calling this function {\tt APFEL} solves the discretized DGLAP
equations using the evolution operators precomputed in the
initialization step.

Now the user can access the evolved PDFs at the scale {\tt Q} via the
use of the functions:
\begin{lstlisting}
   APFEL::xPDF(i,x);
   APFEL::xgamma(x);
\end{lstlisting}
where the real variable {\tt x} is the desired value of Bjorken-$x$
while the integer variable {\tt i} in the function {\tt xPDF}, which
runs from $-$6 to 6, corresponds to the quark flavor index according
to the following convention:
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rcccccccccccccc}
{\tt i}~:  & $-$6 &$-$5 &$-$4&$-$3&$-$2&$-$1&\;0\;&\;1\;&\;2\:&\;3\;&\;4\;&\;5\;&\;6\;\\ 
{\tt xPDF}~: &  $\bar{t}$&$\bar{b}$&$\bar{c}$&$\bar{s}$&$\bar{u}$&$\bar{d}$&
$g$&$d$&$u$&$s$&$c$&$b$&$t$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Note that in {\tt APFEL} we have explicitly separated the access to
the quark and gluon PDFs (via {\tt xPDF}) and from that to the photon
PDF (via {\tt xgamma}). Note also that the functions {\tt xPDF} and
{\tt xgamma} return $x$ times the PDFs ($i.e.$ the momentum
fractions).

The basic information given above is enough to write a simple and yet
complete program that performs PDF evolution using {\tt APFEL}.
%
As an illustration, a {\tt C/C++} program that computes and tabulates
PDFs to be compared with the Les Houches PDF benchmark evolution
tables would be the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>
#include "APFEL/APFEL.h"
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  // Define grid in x
  double xlha[11] = {1e-7, 1e-6, 1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 
		1e-1, 3e-1, 5e-1, 7e-1, 9e-1};
  
  // Precomputes evolution operators on the grid
  APFEL::InitializeAPFEL();

  // Perform evolution
  double Q0 = sqrt(2);
  double Q  = sqrt(10000);
  APFEL::EvolveAPFEL(Q0,Q);

  cout << scientific << setprecision(5) << endl;
  cout << "   x   " 
       << setw(11) << "   u-ubar   " 
       << setw(11) << "   d-dbar   " 
       << setw(11) << " 2(ubr+dbr) " 
       << setw(11) << "   c+cbar   " 
       << setw(11) << "   gluon    " 
       << setw(11) << "   photon   " << endl;

  cout << scientific;
  // Tabulate PDFs for the LHA x values
  for (int i = 0; i < 11; i++)
    cout << xlha[i] << "\t"  
	 << APFEL::xPDF(2,xlha[i]) - APFEL::xPDF(-2,xlha[i]) << "\t"
	 << APFEL::xPDF(1,xlha[i]) - APFEL::xPDF(-1,xlha[i]) << "\t"
	 << 2*(APFEL::xPDF(-1,xlha[i]) + APFEL::xPDF(-2,xlha[i])) << "\t"
	 << APFEL::xPDF(4,xlha[i]) + APFEL::xPDF(-4,xlha[i]) << "\t"
	 << APFEL::xPDF(0,xlha[i]) << "\t"
	 << APFEL::xgamma(xlha[i]) << "\t"
	 << endl;

  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
It should be noticed that this example code uses the default settings
of {\tt APFEL} for the evolution parameters such as: initial scale
PDFs, perturbative order, heavy quark masses, values of the couplings,
etc. In the following we will discuss how the user can customize the
settings for the PDF evolution in {\tt APFEL}.

\subsection{Customization of the PDF evolution}\label{EvolCustom}

The customization of the PDF evolution with {\tt APFEL} can be
achieved using a number of dedicated functions, to be called before
the initialization stage, that is before calling {\tt
  InitializeAPFEL}\footnote{This is not entirely precise because there
  is a number of customization functions that are effective only at
  the evolution level and thus can be called also after {\tt
    InitializeAPFEL} but before {\tt EvolveAPFEL}. We will discuss
  this feature case by case when going through all functions available
  in {\tt APFEL}.}. We will subdivide the available functions into
three cathegories:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \textit{setting functions} which provide the real
  costumization tools. These functions allow the user to change the
  way how the initialization and the output (see next items) functions
  behave.
\item The \textit{initialization functions} which are resposible to
  perform the ``main'' operations, like initializing the evolution
  factor and evolving PDFs.
\item The \textit{output functions} which finally return the result of
  a given set of setting and initialization functions.
\end{itemize}
In the following we will list and comment all the functions belonging
to each of the cathegories above. Finally, we remind the reader
that running the configuration script {\tt apfel-config} with the {\tt
  --list-funcs} flag will list all the functions available in {\tt
  APFEL} along with a short explanation.

\subsubsection{Setting functions}

Bofore going through the various setting functions, the user should be
aware of the fact that {\tt APFEL} has a set of default settings that
are used if the user does not intervene to change any of them. This is
why the example described above needs only a very limited number of
steps. However, while each time that {\tt APFEL} is run a banner with
a list of the main settings is displayed, it is usefull to report here
the default settings of {\tt APFEL}. We will first go through all the
setting functions and only at the end we will report the default
settings so that the meaning of all of them should be clear to the
reader who went through this section. 

Bofore proceeding with the descitpion of the setting functions of the
evolution module, it is useful to notice that in the following we will
use the identifiers {\tt int}, {\tt double}, {\tt bool} and {\tt
  string} to specify the type of entry expected by each of the
fuctions described below.

\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetPerturbativeOrder(int pto);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the perturbative order of the PDF evolution to {\tt
  "pto"}. The integer {\tt "pto"} can take the values 0, 1 ot 2
according to whether the PDF evolution is performed at
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$, $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, or
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$, that is LO, NLO and NNLO,
respectively. This function also sets the perturbative order of the
evolution of the couplings $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha$ and possibly of the
heavy quark masses. The default for {\tt pto"} is 2.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetTheory(string theory);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the theory to be used in the evolution. The
alternatives for {\tt theory} are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt "QCD"}: the PDF evolution is done solving the pure QCD
  DGLAP equations,
\item {\tt "QED"}: the PDF evolution is done solving the pure QED
  DGLAP equations,
\item {\tt "QUniD"}: the PDF evolution is done solving the coupled
  QCD+QED DGLAP equations as explained above.
\end{itemize}
There are more options available that access more ``exotic'' (and
obsolete) solutions of the coupled QCD+QED DGLAP equations. They are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt "QCEDP"} for QCD+QED in parallel,
\item {\tt "QCEDS"} for QCD+QED in series,
\item {\tt "QECDP"} for QED+QCD in parallel,
\item {\tt "QECDS"} for QED+QCD in series,
\item {\tt "QavDP"} for the averaged solution in parallel,
\item {\tt "QavDS"} for the averaged solution in series,
\end{itemize}
and they refer to different combinations of the separate QCD and QED
evolutions. The reader can refer to the original {\tt APFEL}
publication for a detailed explanation. However, the use of these
solution is discouraged unless the user is well aware of their
meaning. The default is {\tt "QCD"}.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetVFNS();
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the Variable-Flavour Number Scheme (VFNS) for the
PDF, $\alpha_s$, and $\alpha$\footnote{In case the
  $\overline{\mbox{MS}}$ definition for the heavy quark masses is used
  (see below) and the running of the masses has been enabled, this
  function sets the VFNS also for the running of the heavy quark
  masses.} evolution. In practice this means that, if any heavy quark
threshold is encountered during the evolution, the solutions of the
DGLAP equation below and above the threshold itself will be properly
matched. This option is used as a default.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetFFNS(int nfl);
\end{lstlisting}
This function, as opposed to {\tt SetVFNS}, sets the Fixed-Flavour
Number Scheme (FFNS) with {\tt "nfl"} active flavours for the PDF,
$\alpha_s$ and $\alpha$ (and $\overline{\mbox{MS}}$) evolution. This
function forces the evolution to be done with {\tt "nfl"} active
flavours in any evolution range. The allowed values are {\tt nfl} = 3,
4, 5 and 6.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetAlphaQCDRef(double alpharef, double Qref);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the reference values of the strong coupling
$\alpha_s$ at the scale {\tt "Qref"} in GeV to {\tt "alpharef"}. The
default is {\tt "alpharef"} = 0.35 at {\tt "Qref"} = $\sqrt{2}$ GeV.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetAlphaQEDRef(double alpharef, double Qref);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the reference values of the QED coupling $\alpha$
at the scale {\tt "Qref"} in GeV to {\tt "alpharef"}. The default is
{\tt "alpharef"} = 7.496252$\cdot 10^{-3}$ at {\tt "Qref"} = 1.777
GeV.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetLambdaQCDRef(double lambdaref, int nref);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the value of $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ in GeV with {\tt
  "nref"} flavours to {\tt "lambdaref"}. This value is used only if
the {\tt "lambda"} solution of the $\beta$-function equation (see below)
is used to compute the running of $\alpha_s$. The default is {\tt
  "lambdaref"} = 0.220 GeV with {\tt "nref"} = 5.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetPoleMasses(double mc, double mb, double mt);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the values of the heavy quark thresholds in GeV and
sets the pole-mass scheme as a renormalization scheme for the heavy
quark masses. This function is used as a default with {\tt "mc"} =
$\sqrt{2}$ GeV, {\tt "mb"} = 4.5 GeV, {\tt "mt"} = 175 GeV.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetMSbarMasses(double mc, double mb, double mt);
     sets the values of the heavy quark thresholds
     in GeV in the MSbar scheme.
\end{lstlisting}
This function, as opposed to {\tt SetPoleMasses}, sets the values of
the heavy quark masses in GeV and sets the $\overline{\mbox{MS}}$
scheme as a renormalization scheme for the heavy quark masses. The
reference scales at which the masses are defined can be specified
using the {\tt SetMassScaleReference} function (see below).
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetMassScaleReference(double Qc, double Qb, double Qt);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the reference scales in GeV at which heavy quark
masses are given. This function is effective only if the
$\overline{\mbox{MS}}$ definition for the heavy quark masses is used
and has no effect if the pole masses are used. If this function is not
called, {\tt APFEL} will assume that the mass reference scales are
equal to the masses themselves. In other words, in the absence of a
call to this function when using the $\overline{\mbox{MS}}$ definition
for the heavy quark masses, the {\tt SetMSbarMasses} function will
define $m_c(m_c)$, $m_b(m_b)$ and $m_t(m_t)$. If instead this function
is called and the reference scales are found to be different from the
masses themselves, the values of $m_c(m_c)$, $m_b(m_b)$ and $m_t(m_t)$
are also evaluated by applying the RG evolution as they are needed as
thresholds for the VFNS evolution when using the
$\overline{\mbox{MS}}$ definition for the heavy quark masses.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::EnableMassRunning(bool);
\end{lstlisting}
This function enables or disables the running of the
$\overline{\mbox{MS}}$ masses.  This is effective only if the {\tt
  SetMSbarMasses} is also called and in practice switches on and off
the solution RG equation of the heavy quark masses. The default is
{\tt true}.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetTauMass(double mtau);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the values of the $\tau$ lepton in GeV to {\tt
  mtau}. This function is effective only if the evolution of the
lepton PDFs is enabled (see below). The default is {\tt "mtau"} =
1.777 GeV.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetMaxFlavourAlpha(int nf);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the maximum number of active flavours in the
evolution of the couplings $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha$ (and the masses) to
{\tt nf}. In practice, this function forces the code not to match the
solution of the $\beta$-function and $\gamma$-function equations at a
given threshold if that threshold is above the maximum number allowed
{\tt nf}. The default is {\tt "nf"} = 6.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetMaxFlavourPDFs(int nf);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the maximum number of active flavours in the
evolution of PDFs to {\tt nf}. In practice, this function forces the
code not to match the solution of the DGLAP equation at a given
threshold if that threshold is above the maximum number allowed {\tt
  nf}. The default is {\tt "nf"} = 6.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetRenFacRatio(double ratio);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the ratio between factorization scale $\mu_F$
(entering PDFs) and renormalization scale $\mu_R$ (entering the
couplings and possibly the heavy quark masses) to {\tt "ratio"}. If
{\tt "ratio"} is different from one, {\tt APFEL} will assume that
$\mu_R$ = $\mu_F /$ {\tt "ratio"} and, as explained above, this gives
rise to additional terms in the higher order splitting functions. The
default is {\tt "ratio"} = 1.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetTimeLikeEvolution(bool);
\end{lstlisting}
This function enables or disables the time-like evolution. This
evolution, as opposed to the space-like evolution used for PDFs, is
used to evolve fragmentation functions (FFs). The default is {\tt
  false}.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetSmallxResummation(bool, string la);
\end{lstlisting}
This function enables or disables the small-$x$ resummation in the
evolution and set the logarithmic accuracy of the resummation to {\tt
  "la"}. The possible options for {\tt la"} are {\tt "LL"} and {\tt
  "NLL"}. The small-$x$ resummation of the evolution relies on an
  external code called {\tt HELL} that returns the difference between
  the fixed-order and the resummed splitting functions as explained
  above. By default, the small-$x$ resummation is disabled.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetAlphaEvolution(string evol);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the solution of the $\beta$-function equations for
the running couplings to {\tt "evol"}. The variable {\tt "evol"} can
take the following strings:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt "exact"}: the $\beta$-function equations are solved
  numerically in an exact way using the Runge-Kutta method. The
  boundary condition is given by the reference values of the coupling
  at the reference scales.
\item {\tt "expanded"}: the $\beta$-function equations are solved
  analytically by expanding the inverse of the $\beta$-function when
  computing the solution of the RG equation. See above for more
  details. The boundary condition is given by the reference values of
  the coupling at the reference scales.
\item {\tt "lambda"}: the $\beta$-function equations are solved in an
  analytical way in terms of the Landau pole $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. See
  above for more details.
\end{itemize}
It should be noticed that a different choice of {\tt "evol"} only
affects the running of $\alpha_s$ beyond LO while the running of
$\alpha$, being computed always at LO, is left unchanged. The default
is {\tt "evol"} = {\tt "exact"}.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetPDFEvolution(string evolp);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the solution of the DGLAP equations for the
evolution of PDFs to {\tt "evolp"}. The variable {\tt "evolp"} can
take the following strings:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt "exactmu"}: the DGLAP equation differential in the
  factorization scale $\mu_F$ is solved numerically in an exact way
  using the Runge-Kutta method.
\item {\tt "exactalpha"}: the DGLAP equation differential in the
  coupling $\alpha_s$ is solved numerically in an exact way using the
  Runge-Kutta method. This solution is completely equivalent to {\tt
    exactmu}.
\item {\tt "expandalpha"}: the DGLAP equation differential in the
  coupling $\alpha_s$ is solved analytically by expanding the ratio
  between splitting functions and $\beta$-function. See above for more
  details.
\item {\tt "truncated"}: this solution mimics the $N$-space truncated
  solution and its implementation requires the numerical derivatives
  of the {\tt expandalpha} solution. A detailed explanantion of the
  implementation of thsi particular solution is given above.
\end{itemize}
In all cases the boundary conditions are given by the input initial
scale PDFs. The default is {\tt "evol"} = {\tt "exact"}.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetEpsilonTruncation(double eps);
\end{lstlisting}
If the {\tt truncated} evolution for PDFs has been chosen by calling
the {\tt SetPDFEvolution} function, the {\tt SetEpsilonTruncation}
function sets the truncation parameter $\epsilon$ used to compute the
numerical dericatives to {\tt eps}.
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetPDFSet(string name);
\end{lstlisting}
This function sets the PDF set to be evolved to {\tt "name"}. The
string variable {\tt "name"} can be the name of an LHAPDF set and in
this case it must finish with the string {\tt ".LHgrid"}. This is
needed to distinguish the LHAPDF sets from the other possible options
available. The other possible options for {\tt "name"} are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt "private"}:
\item {\tt "apfel"}:
\item {\tt "ToyLH"}:
\item {\tt "external"}:
\item {\tt "external1"}:
\item {\tt "repexternal"}:
\item {\tt "leptexternal"}:
\item {\tt "kretzer"}:
\item {\tt "MELA"}:
\item {\tt "pretabulated"}:
\item {\tt "pretabulated1"}:
\end{itemize}
The default is {\tt "name"} = {\tt "ToyLH"}.

\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetReplica(int nr);
     sets the replica/member of the LHAPDF set to be
     evolved (default "nr" = 0).
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetQLimits(double Qmin, double Qmax);
     sets the range where it is possible to perform
     the evolution (default "Qmin" = 0.5 GeV, "Qmax"
     = 1000 GeV).
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetNumberOfGrids(int n);
     sets the number of subgrids "n" (default 3)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::SetGridParameters(int i, int n, int deg, double x);
     sets the parameter of the i-th subgrid. "n" =
     number intevals, "deg" = interpolation order,
     "x" lower bound of the grid (the upper bound is
     always 1).
\end{lstlisting}

As clear, the most important settings are reported in the banner and
we recommand to consult the banner every time that {\tt APFEL} is run
to make sure that the desired setting are actually used.

Here is the complete set of default settings used by {\tt APFEL}:
\begin{lstlisting}
  APFEL::EnableWelcomeMessage(true);
  APFEL::SetQLimits(0.5,100000);
  APFEL::SetPerturbativeOrder(2);
  APFEL::SetVFNS
  APFEL::SetTheory("QCD");
  APFEL::SetFastEvolution(true);
  APFEL::SetTimeLikeEvolution(false);
  APFEL::SetSmallxResummation(false,"NLL");
  APFEL::SetAlphaQCDRef(0.35,sqrt(2););
  APFEL::SetAlphaQEDRef(7.496252e-3,1.777);
  APFEL::SetLambdaQCDRef(0.220,5);

  APFEL::EnableMassRunning(true);
  APFEL::SetMaxFlavourPDFs(6);

  APFEL::EnableEvolutionOperator(false);
  APFEL::EnableLeptonEvolution(false);

  APFEL::SetGridParameters(1,80,3,1e-5);
  APFEL::SetGridParameters(2,50,5,1e-1);
  APFEL::SetGridParameters(3,40,5,8e-1);
\end{lstlisting}


As an illustration, if the user wants to perform the QCD evolution at NLO
instead of  the default NNLO, she/he needs to add to the code above,
before the initialization routine {\tt InitializeAPFEL}, a call to the
corresponding function, that is:
\begin{lstlisting}
 APFEL::SetPerturbativeOrder(1);
\end{lstlisting}
or if the user wants to use as a boundary condition for the PDF
evolution a particular set available through the {\tt LHAPDF} interface, say
{\tt NNPDF23\_nlo\_as\_0118\_qed.LHgrid}, she/he needs
to call before the initialization the following function:
\begin{lstlisting}
 APFEL::SetPDFSet("NNPDF23_nlo_as_0118_qed.LHgrid");
\end{lstlisting}
By default, {\tt APFEL} will use the central replica of
the selected PDF set. 
%
Varying any other setting is similar, various example programs
have been collected in the {\tt examples} folder in the {\tt APFEL} source
folder.
%

When modifying the default settings, particular care 
must be taken with the number of interpolation grids, the number
of points in each grid and the order of the interpolation.
%
The  default
settings in {\tt APFEL} use three grids whose ranges and
number of points have been tuned to give accurate and
fast results over a wide range of $x$.
%
If the default parameters are modified, the user should check
that the accuracy is still good enough, by comparing for instance
with another run of {\tt APFEL} with the default interpolation
parameters.

The folder {\tt examples} in the {\tt APFEL} source directory contains
several examples that further illustrate the functionalities of
the code, and that can be used by the user as a starting point
towards a program that suits her/his particular physics needs.
%
All these examples are available in the three possible interfaces to
{\tt APFEL}: {\scshape Fortran 77}, {\tt C/C++} and {\tt Python}.
